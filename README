This project contains example for for effectively applying inheritance for unit
test code re-use. This project also provides alternatives to demonstrate the
inheritance's effectiveness. We illustrate by implementing and testing a couple
of implementations of Map.

Inheritance can be used to test the common requirements of differing
implementations. To apply the inhertance you follow these steps:
1. Create an abstract class for the common unit tests
2. Add an abstract method that expects the extender to provide the real
   implemenation
3. Add @Tests the verify the requirements of the interface
4. Create a unit test class for each implementation and extend from the abstract
   unit test class
5. Provide the real implementation expected by the abstract method
6. Add any additional @Tests that test requirements specific to the
   implementation
